              <p>Otherwise known as HOG, this Java-program is a feature descriptor that should be used to detect silhouettes of the objects in a photo.
              The parameters requrie users to first enter the file path of the image, then enter in the block-size used to create the histograms. After the user
            has entered a block size, which must be 2^n, the vectors will populate on top of the image. The resulting magnitude and direction of each vector
              create the final output</p>

              <p>This project was written in the C-programming language. The purpose of this program is to search through
              a set of documents to determine the relevance of the documents with respect to a search phrase/query. This
            was implemented using hash tables and linkedlists to organize the contents of each document. Using the term frequency-inverse document frequency method,
          a list of scores is generated to determine the most to least relevant documents. </p>

          </header>
              <p>This progam was written in python and uses an automobile dataset to determine which factors contrinute to price the most and to predict price given attribute values.
              To create the final price prediction model, the data needed to be cleaned, trained, and tested. This program uses a vareity of analytical tools such as Cross Validation, Ridge Regression, and Grid Search to determine the best model. </p>

              <p>This chatbot was made using Watson Assistant. The purpose of this bot is to help new Washington, DC IBMers navigate IBM's resources.  This bot can
              answer questions about business travel, fun activities to participate in, reccomended coursework, and even what kind of smoothies you should buy at the Bethesda, MD's local cafe.
              This bot is hosted on IBM's public cloud.   </p>

              <p>MoBambweb Information is comprised of registration, advising, and application segments. Application has prospective students submit and there required documents needed to gain admission. Reviewers evaluate applicants and the CAC can admit applicants. Once admitted, applicants become students who need to fill out a University Advising Form to register for courses. Students also need to eventually fill out a form1 and in order to successfully graduate. All students can be assigned and advisor and can update their personal information as well. Once a student has met all their degree requirements and applied to graduate, the system admin or the graduate secretary can convert them from a student into an alumnus. This project required use of PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS in order to create a full-stack program.
